# CodeAlpha_carpriceprediction
Project Summary
This project develops a regression model to predict car prices based on features such as brand, horsepower, mileage, and other vehicle characteristics. The workflow includes data cleaning, preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, evaluation, and model saving.

Dataset
Contains car-related attributes and corresponding prices.

Dataset is uploaded directly in Google Colab as a CSV file.

Tools and Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR)

Joblib for saving the trained model

Methodology
Upload and load the dataset

Handle missing values and clean data

Identify numerical and categorical features

Apply encoding and scaling using a preprocessing pipeline

Train multiple regression models

Use cross-validation to compare model performance

Select the best model and evaluate it on test data

Visualize actual vs predicted prices

Save the final trained model

Outcome
A regression model capable of predicting car prices with good accuracy, useful for pricing insights and automotive market analysis.
